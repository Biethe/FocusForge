## 2026-07-28 — Phase 1: Walking-skeleton APK + silicon probe

**Did**
- Built the first installable app. One screen ("Probe") that shows, refreshed every second:
  phone model, Android version, supported ABIs, CPU core count grouped into clusters by their
  max frequency, the raw CPU Features line with a clear YES/NO verdict for `asimddp` and
  `i8mm`, total RAM, and thermal status (on Android 10+). A "Share probe JSON" button exports
  everything through the normal Android share menu.
- Kept it deliberately tiny: no libraries at all beyond the Kotlin standard one. The APK is
  **2.3 MB** (the red-flag line was 30 MB). The manifest declares **zero permissions** — CI
  now fails the build if any permission ever sneaks in.
- CI now really builds the APK on every push and publishes it to a rolling "dev-latest"
  pre-release so the operator can download it straight from the phone's browser.
- Installed a local build toolchain on the PC (JDK 17, Gradle 8.7, Android SDK 34 in the
  home folder) so compile errors are caught before pushing; CI remains the official builder.

**Evidence**
- Green CI run (both jobs): https://github.com/Biethe/FocusForge/actions/runs/30367768698
- APK download page: https://github.com/Biethe/FocusForge/releases/tag/dev-latest
- The same CI run's log ("Verify no INTERNET permission" step) shows the aapt2 permissions
  dump containing no permission lines.
- On-phone numbers (clusters, features, RAM as the A20e reports them): NOT MEASURED YET —
  waiting for operator to install and share the probe JSON.

**Next**
- Operator installs the APK on the A20e, checks 8 cores / 2 clusters and NO asimddp/i8mm,
  and shares the probe JSON to the architect chat. Then Phase 2: CameraX + MediaPipe
  FaceLandmarker with the perf HUD.

**Risks**
- Sideloading warnings (Play Protect) can look scary — instructions below explain exactly
  what to expect so nothing is tapped in panic.
- Thermal status needs Android 10+; if the A20e is still on Android 9 the app will say so
  honestly rather than show a number.
- The probe reads `/sys/.../cpuinfo_max_freq`; a few devices block this. The app shows
  "?" instead of guessing if that happens — report it if you see it.

## 2026-07-28 — Phase 0: Repo and rails

**Did**
- Turned the planning folder into a real project: added the MIT license, a .gitignore that
  guarantees model weights and build junk are never committed, empty templates for this log and
  the decision log, and a scripts/ folder. Moved the planning docs (PROMPTS, RESOURCES,
  SUPERVISION) into docs/ where the constitution expects them.
- Connected the folder to the GitHub repo **FocusForge** (it already existed on the Biethe
  account from an earlier attempt, with unrelated stub history — merged, nothing lost) and made
  it **public**, which the hackathon requires and which gives us free Arm build machines.
- Added the first CI workflow: a placeholder build job, plus an "arm-probe" job that runs on
  GitHub's Arm machine and saves a report of its processor.
- Verified CI runs green and downloaded the probe report: the CI machine is a **Neoverse-N2**
  and its Features line contains `asimddp`, `i8mm`, and `sve2` — the modern-Arm half of our
  two-device story (the phone has none of these).

**Evidence**
- Public repo: https://github.com/Biethe/FocusForge (opens without login; About shows MIT).
- Green CI run: https://github.com/Biethe/FocusForge/actions/runs/30365607803
- Probe report committed at `bench/probes/ci-neoverse-n2-de5f784.txt` (from that run's
  `probe-ci` artifact). Check the "Features" line for `asimddp` and `i8mm`.
- Phone-side numbers: NOT MEASURED YET (no app exists yet — that's Phase 1).

**Next**
- Phase 1: scaffold the Android app with the single "Probe" screen, build the APK in CI,
  publish it to a rolling "dev-latest" pre-release, and the operator installs it on the
  Samsung A20e.

**Risks**
- The GitHub login on this PC stores credentials in plain text (gh's default here) — fine for
  a hackathon, but don't reuse that account password anywhere sensitive.
- Two leftover repos exist on the account (`ArmFatigue`, old name) — harmless, but deleting
  it later avoids confusion. This folder now pushes to FocusForge only.
